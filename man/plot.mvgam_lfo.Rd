\title{Plot Pareto-k and ELPD values from a leave-future-out object}
\usage{
\method{plot}{mvgam_lfo}(x, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{An object of class \code{mvgam_lfo}}

\item{...}{Ignored}
}
\value{
A base \code{R} plot of Pareto-k and ELPD values over the
evaluation timepoints. For the Pareto-k plot, a dashed red line indicates the
specified threshold chosen for triggering model refits. For the ELPD plot,
a dashed red line indicated the bottom 10\% quantile of ELPD values. Points below
this threshold may represent outliers that were more difficult to forecast
}
\description{
This function takes an object of class \code{mvgam_lfo} and create several
informative diagnostic plots
